FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Directory 'C:\Users\Admin\slf-p1-b2-mar24\slf-java-b2-p1' does not contain a Gradle build.

A Gradle build should contain a 'settings.gradle' or 'settings.gradle.kts' file in its root directory. It may also contain a 'build.gradle' or 'build.gradle.kts' file.

To create a new Gradle build in this directory run 'gradle init'

For more information about the 'init' task, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.6/userguide/build_init_plugin.html in the Gradle documentation.

For more details on creating a Gradle build, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.6/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html in the Gradle documentation.

* Try:
> Run gradle init to create a new Gradle build in this directory.
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Get more help at https://help.gradle.org.
